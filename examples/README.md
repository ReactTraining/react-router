React Router Examples
=====================

To run the examples in your development environment:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`
4. Point your browser to http://localhost:8080

====================

In most of the examples, we will use ES6 syntax. Now, we have one minor plot twist to our regular ES6 component. We will use import React, { Component } so we won't have to rewrite React.Component a bunch of times. It will look somewhat similar to this: 

    import React, { Component } from 'react'
    
    class Calendar extends Component {
    // Our code
     }
