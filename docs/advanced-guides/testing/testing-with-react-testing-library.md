# Testing With React Testing Library

`react-testing-library` is a lightweight family of packages that help us test UI components in a manner that resembles the way a user would interact with our applications.

To quote their (very excellent) documentation:

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.
